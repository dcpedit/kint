# KinT Blackpill Edition

This is a fork of Michael Stapelberg's KinT project (https://github.com/kinx-project/kint#using-socket-headers) with the following modifications:

* Replaced Teensy with Blackpill controller
* Reduced PCB size to 100 x 86 mm
* Use Vial firmware.  Source code is in my [fork of Vial](https://github.com/dcpedit/vial-qmk/tree/vial/keyboards/dcpedit/kint_bp)
